		<h1>Subtraction Angio-CT</h1>
		<div id="text">
		<p><span class="title">Description:</span> With the recent multi-dectector CT, angio-CT of the lower limbs is considered as a good alternative to classic angiography. However, bones and extensive calcified plaques of arteries complicate the interpretation of these exams and often require extensive 3D post-processing to clearly demonstrate the arterial tree. We elected to develop a new technique to ease the interpretation and the post-processing of the lower limb angio-CT: 2 series are performed on the lower limbs, one without contrast and one with I.V. contrast. These 2 series are then subtracted to obtain a series without calcification and bones.</p>
