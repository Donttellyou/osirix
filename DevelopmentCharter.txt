The goal of OsiriX software is to deliver the best possible DICOM viewer for images produced with radiology equipment: displaying, reviewing, interpreting and post-processing.

We aim to do this in part by (sorted by order of importance):

- Delivering a software with a minimum of bugs (crashes, memory leaks, artifacts, GUI inconsistence, É) - DONT COMMIT BUGS !

- Delivering a well tested and validated software - TEST YOUR COMMITS with different dataset and scenarios !

- Delivering an optimized software that works rapidly and that uses the available hardware effectively - Multi-Threading, Optimized algorithms, Effective memory management, É  

- Delivering a software that works on the entire range of MacOS computers: laptops, workstations, small CPU, different graphic boards, É

- Developing and maintaining the existing features - If you add new features, be sure the 'old' features are still working - TEST, TEST, AND RE-TEST

- Describing your source code : clear names for function and variables, documented function

- Working on one part of OsiriX at a time - We need to understand the modifications on the svn server - DO NOT MODIFY multiples functions and multiple classes at a time ! NO TRANSVERSAL MODIFICATIONS

- Delivering the right set of USEFUL features - not too many (the goal is to create a DICOM viewer, not a word processor, a disk utility, a new Photoshop, É)

- Keeping the download size down - DO NOT ADD LIBRARIES/FUNCTIONS THAT *COULD BE* maybe, later useful
